## Hypothesis
**tinywebcode** was a personal project to:
* host lots of half-baked tiny webapps for as cheaply as possible

---
## Project Structure
     tinywebcode/                                 <-- Root of your project
       |- .dockerignore                           <-- Docker ignore file
       |- .gitignore                              <-- Git ignore file
       |- README.md                               <-- This README markdown file
       +- fastchart/                              <-- Holds any files for Fastchart API

## Methodology

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) to test the above hypothesis.

### Non-existant viable feature
* host lots of half-baked tiny webapps for as cheaply as possible

### Existing viable feature

* free deploy runner: GitHub Action
* free tier serverless host: Netlify, Vercel
* free tier containerized serverless host: Google Cloud Run (GCR) (Crai2020_2)
* paid server host: DigitalOcean, GoDaddy

---
## Complexity

Count the cost of complexity, i.e. incremental reward and risk reduction, before evolving MVP.

### Non-existant bloat
* free tier deploy runner: Octopus Deploy
* free static host: GitHub Pages, Surge (Crai2020)
* free tier static host: Hostman
* free tier dynamic webapp host: Heroku, Glitch (Crai2020), Uffizzi
* paid serverless host (FAAS): AWS Lambda, Azure, Google Cloud Function (GCF) (Crai2020)

### Existing bloat 
* Nil
